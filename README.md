## 📖 About the Project

**Crypto - GreateStack** is a modern, responsive web application built using React and Vite. It provides real-time information and detailed insights about various cryptocurrencies. The app includes:

- A **homepage** that likely lists different coins with relevant information.
- A **dedicated page for each coin**, accessible via dynamic routing (`/coin/:coinId`).
- A **navigation bar and footer** for consistent layout and user navigation.

### 🔍 Use Cases

This project can be used for:

- **Cryptocurrency research**: Users can look up detailed information on specific coins.
- **Educational purposes**: Great for learning about React, routing (`react-router-dom`), context management, and working with crypto APIs.
- **Portfolio projects**: A strong example for showcasing full-stack front-end development skills.

### 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Vite** – Fast development server and build tool.
- **React** – JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router** – Routing and navigation between pages.
- **Context API** – For global state management (`CoinContextProvider`).
- **Modern CSS** – For responsive and clean UI.

You can extend this app by:
- Integrating real-time price charts.
- Adding authentication for tracking favorite coins.
- Implementing dark mode for better UX.
